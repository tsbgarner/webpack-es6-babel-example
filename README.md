# webpack, ES6 and Babel Example

This is a small example tutorial project I wrote as a reference to show how webpack and babel.js can be used to develop in ES6 and transpile to ES5.

## Requirements

* npm

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Build with Webpack

```
npm run build
```

That's it!
